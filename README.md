# FNMZ
What is it? FNMZ is an algorithm to calculate Z-eigenvalue of symmetric tensor. 
This set of MATLAB files implements the methods described in

[1] J.F. Xu, D.-H. Li, and X.L. Bai, Feasible newton methods for symmetric tensor z-eigenvalue problems, Optimization Methods and Software, 38 (2023), pp. 510â€“528.

How to use it? There are four files:

'demo': MATLAB script files with the example 1 detailed in [1];

'demo3': MATLAB script files with the example 3 detailed in [1];

'alg2': The Algorithm 2 in [1];

'alg3': The Algorithm 3 in [1];

This version of files was tested using MATLAB R2022a on a Windows 11 machine with the tensor toolbox [2] to proceed tensor computation.
