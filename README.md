# FNMZ
What is it?
FNMZ is an algorithm to calculate Z-eigenvalue of symmetric tensor. 
This set of MATLAB files implements the methods described in

[1] J.F. Xu, D.-H. Li, and X.L. Bai, Feasible newton methods for symmetric tensor z-eigenvalue problems, Optimization Methods and Software, 38 (2023), pp. 510â€“528.

How to use it?
There are three folders that contain:

'demos': MATLAB script files with some of the examples detailed in [1];

'FNM':   the source code.

This version of FNM was tested using MATLAB R2022a on a Windows 11 machine.
We employ the tensor toolbox [2] to proceed tensor computation.
